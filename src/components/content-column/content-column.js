        <p>I'm looking to join a high quality team of designers and developers to apply my skills, continue growing as a developer, and start working with clients to provide . As a recent graduate of Thinkful's full time Engineering Immersion program, I have acquired working experience building front end web clients with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, running web servers and writing RESTFUL apis using Node.js/Express, and integrating both relational and non-relational databases using MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. Beyond this full stack foundation, I have worked intensively and continue to build web applications with MVC frameworks - specifically with React.</p>
